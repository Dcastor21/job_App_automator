This program is written in Python and is designed to automate the process of applying to job listings on a specific website. The program will prompt the user to input their login information for the website, as well as the specific job page they would like to apply to.

Getting Started
To run the program, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-automation.git
Setup
Before you can use the program, you will need to provide your login information for the website you want to apply to. The program will prompt you to enter your login credentials when you run it for the first time.

You will also need to specify the specific job page you would like to apply to. You can do this by providing the URL of the job page to the program.

Usage

The program will prompt you to enter your login information and the URL of the job page. Once you have provided this information, the program will automatically apply to the job listings on that page.

Future Development
This program is currently in development, and we plan to add more features in the future. Some of the features we are considering include:

Adding support for multiple job websites
Allowing users to apply to multiple job listings at once
Adding a feature to automatically fill out job application forms
